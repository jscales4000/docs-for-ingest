# Github Doc Portal — Session Log

## [2025-08-28 11:31] Session Summary

Project: Github Doc Portal — A centralized Knowledge Base repo to train the Archon MCP server by ingesting curated documentation from external web links and local markdown. It standardizes sources, maintains link manifests and summaries, and enables reliable RAG indexing. The repo prioritizes clean, structured markdown with citations and stable URLs. Documentation is versioned with a human-readable Project Log and session-based catch-up entries.

**Key Decisions Made:** Initialize KB repo with README and logging conventions to support Archon ingestion.

**Technical Direction:** Pure markdown document portal with `/sources` for link manifests and `/docs` for curated content; session logging under `/catch-up/` to track ingestion/curation decisions.

**Files Modified/Created:** 
- `README.md` - Repo purpose, structure, and contribution guidelines
- `Project Log.md` - Versioned human-readable log
- `catch-up/session-log.md` - Session log per rule

**Next Steps:** Initialize git, commit initial files, and push to GitHub; then add initial `/sources` manifest template.

## [2025-08-28 11:39] Session Summary

**Key Decisions Made:** Make repo public and safe for ingestion; add security/contribution policies and Git LFS patterns.

**Technical Direction:** Public GitHub repo with branch protection and LFS for binaries; standardized `/sources` manifest for external links.

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `SECURITY.md` - Public access posture and reporting
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution workflow and guardrails
- `.gitignore` - Ignore artifacts and secrets
- `.gitattributes` - LFS patterns and text normalization
- `sources/manifest-template.json` - Example manifest for external sources
- `Project Log.md` - Added version 0.2.0 entry

**Next Steps:** Stage and push updates; consider `git lfs install` and `git lfs migrate` for existing large binaries; enable branch protection in GitHub settings.
